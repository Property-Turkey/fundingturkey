                <p>Funding Turkey establishes and manages investments via real estate funds, as well as venture capital 
                funds, within the framework of the Turkish Capital Markets (SPK) Law and relevant legislative provisions. 
                By creating funds comprised of expertly sourced real estate and promising commercial ventures, 
                Funding Turkey has statistically positioned itself at the forefront of the Turkish marketplace.
                For over 20 years, through partnership with Property Turkey, our investors consistently attain the 
                low-risk/high-returns they pursue in a volatile market.</p>

                <p>In our humble beginnings, as a boutique real estate company, we were solely focused on helping 
                people realize their dream of home ownership. This was our genesis. Our foundation that would evolve 
                into Turkey’s top real estate EcoSystem. Boasting two decades of consistent, organic growth, Property 
                Turkey earned its expertise and market insight that allows it to provide an unparalleled opportunity in 
                Turkey. Especially to those seeking a better way to manage and grow their wealth internationally.</p>
            ",
            "tab_p2_1" => "
                <p>This growth path came organically for Property Turkey. However, it is quite a revolutionary 
                occurrence for a Turkish real estate firm to expand and enter highly lucrative capital fund markets. 
                Until now, only big banks and large institutions had the ability to benefit from the operation of 
                substantial REIF’s and VCIF’s, in Turkey.</p>

                <p>Today, Funding Turkey blazes the trail for real estate companies who aspire to compete with the 
                banking titans of the investment industry. We also are representative of the fervent and explosive 
                economic expansion that is developing within Turkish borders. However, it is our expertise and innovation 
                that places us ahead of our competition and top of our industry.</p>

                <p>We build on a phenomenal history that stretches back into the last century. Although, it’s our future 
                unfolding this century that shines brightest, teeming with growth and promise.</p>

                <p>One of the distinguishing factors when comparing Funding Turkey with our competitors is our Management 
                Structure; specifically our optimization of the Property Turkey EcoSystem. It is very common for other 
                funds to partner with third party companies within the real estate sector to subsidize their inexperience 
                in the real estate industry. Simply put, they lack the specific skills required to recognize opportunity 
                and manage investments in the real estate sector.</p> 

                <p>Their expertise is weighted toward broad asset management. When investing in real estate, we believe 
                that it is absolutely crucial for managing partners to have expertise in managing assets AND investing 
                in real estate in order to excel. Property Turkey has decades of experience as a leader in the Turkish 
                real estate market, specifically when it comes to servicing foreign buyers in the resale market. </p>

                <p>We have accrued a unique, but necessary 
                perspective needed to take the advantage in such a homogeneous industry of banks and institutional investors.</p>

                <p>Property Turkey’s longstanding infrastructure has served our clients’ needs from A to Z; land 
                purchases, new construction, renovation, design & build services, legal services, investment projects, 
                vacation villas, rental and property management, and now fund management. This, and our profitable 
                results for clients, firmly establish us as real estate experts first and asset managers second. So for 
                Funding Turkey, there is no need to outsource services in situations that don’t benefit the profitability 
                of the fund. In our view this model is the most efficient and competitive financial instrument that 
                exists in the Turkish market.</p>

                estate deal making. We have seen it all in Turkish real estate since 2001, good deals, bad deals, scams,
                you name it.</p>

                <p>The type of real estate property doesn’t matter as much to us as being to apply these three principles to
                any real estate transaction:</p>
            
                <p>1. Buy Below Market Value - We need to get in low relative to comps and other market expectations. Our
                elite real estate network usually acts as the catalyst for opportunities that others can’t access.</p>

                <p>2. Ensure Stable Income - The Turkish market is emerging onto the global scene. But, it has a reputation
                as being more volatile compared to developed markets. It is vital to be able to secure reliable and stable
                income from our assets month after month. That is why we have established our own in-house Property
                Management company to service all of our assets.</p>

                ensures a clean exit every time. That is due to the liquidity Property Turkey’s marketplace opens up for
                our assets.</p>
